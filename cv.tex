\newcommand{\header}[1]{\vspace{2em}\par \textbf{\large #1}\strut\hrule\vspace{0em}}
%par makes it always go to the next line, strut produces slight vertical offset
% for the rule.

\newcommand{\actionHeader}[2]{\textbf{#1 \hfill #2}}
\newcommand{\indentedItemDate}[2]{\newline\null\qquad #1 \hfill #2}
\newcommand{\indentedItem}[1]{\newline\null\qquad #1}
% null lets the indents work after the space. Newlines allows me to have less
% whitespace in the Latex file.
